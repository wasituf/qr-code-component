## My process

I started this project by looking through the design images and style guide. I first imported the design image in Figma to get a sense of the dimensions and radius and then went on from there. The solution involves creating a card that includes an image and 2 text elements. The card is centered on the screen and so are the texts inside it. Both the card and the image has a border radius and the card also has a padding to match the design. The only place I was stuck a little bit was containing the text to match the image. I ultimately fixed it with a max-width property of 250px on both the texts.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - This is the best CSS reset I've found so far. It is really handy for starting out any project and I recommend trying it out. I tweeked it a little bit to conform it to my use case.
